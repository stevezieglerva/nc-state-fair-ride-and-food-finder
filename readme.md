# NC State Fair Food Finder

This is a sample site to provide a more user friendly way to find food vendors at the NC State Fair. The current website links to an ESRI GIS map that is very hard to use.

The data is created from the [nc-state-fair-vendor-esri-converter](https://github.com/stevezieglerva/nc-state-fair-vendor-esri-converter) project.
